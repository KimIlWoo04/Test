Executive Summary The Generative AI Travel Planner is a serverless web application designed to help travelers, travel agencies, and tourism professionals create personalized travel itineraries efficiently. By inputting destination, trip duration, and interests, users receive AI-generated day-by-day plans with activities, timing, and descriptions tailored to their preferences. The platform is built on AWS services such as AWS Lambda and Bedrock to enhance user experiences in real-world applications, with potential applications in tourism businesses, travel startups, and personal trip planning.\n2. Problem Statement The Problem? Planning a multi-day trip requires significant time and effort to research destinations, coordinate activities, and create a cohesive itinerary. Travelers often spend hours browsing multiple websites, blogs, and reviews to piece together daily plans that match their interests and available time. Travel agencies and tourism professionals face similar challenges when creating customized itineraries for clients, leading to repetitive manual work. There is a need for an intelligent, automated solution that can generate personalized travel plans quickly while maintaining quality and relevance to user preferences.\nThe Solution and Benefits The platform leverages AWS Amplify to provide a fully serverless web application with continuous deployment capabilities. User requests are processed through a GraphQL API built with AWS AppSync, which communicates with AWS Lambda functions for backend logic. Amazon Bedrock with the Claude Haiku foundation model generates intelligent, context-aware itineraries based on user inputs. Amplify Auth manages user authentication and secure access to the application. The solution offers a simple HTML-based interface where users submit their destination, trip duration, and interests, then receive comprehensive day-by-day itineraries with activities, timing, and descriptions.\nKey benefits include rapid itinerary generation that saves hours of manual research, personalized recommendations tailored to individual preferences, and a scalable architecture that can handle multiple concurrent users. The serverless approach ensures cost efficiency through pay-per-use pricing while demonstrating practical integration of generative AI with modern AWS services. The platform can be extended for travel agencies, tourism businesses, or personal trip planning applications.\n3. Solution Architecture The platform employs a serverless AWS architecture to deliver an AI-powered travel itinerary generation system. User requests flow through AWS Amplify\u0026rsquo;s hosted web interface, where inputs are processed via a GraphQL API managed by AWS AppSync. Backend logic is handled by AWS Lambda functions, which interact with Amazon Bedrock to generate personalized itineraries using the Claude Haiku foundation model. User authentication and access control are managed through Amplify Auth with Amazon Cognito integration. The architecture is detailed below:\nAWS Services Used AWS Amplify: Hosts the HTML-based web interface with continuous deployment capabilities. AWS AppSync: Manages the GraphQL API for efficient data operations and real-time communication between frontend and backend. AWS Lambda: Executes backend processing logic and handles requests for AI-generated itineraries. Amazon Bedrock: Provides access to the Claude Haiku foundation model for intelligent itinerary generation. Amazon Cognito (via Amplify Auth): Manages user authentication and secures application access. Component Design Web Interface: AWS Amplify hosts the HTML-based user interface where users input destination, trip duration, and interests, then view generated itineraries. API Layer: AWS AppSync provides a GraphQL API that facilitates communication between the frontend and backend services. Backend Processing: AWS Lambda functions handle business logic, process user requests, and coordinate interactions with other AWS services. AI Generation: Amazon Bedrock with Claude Haiku foundation model generates personalized, context-aware travel itineraries based on user inputs. User Management: Amplify Auth with Amazon Cognito manages user registration, authentication, and secure access to the application. 4. Technical Implementation Frontend Application: HTML-based user interface with form inputs for destination, number of days, and interests. The interface displays AI-generated itineraries in a structured format with day-by-day breakdown including activities, timing, and descriptions. Backend Services: AWS Lambda functions to handle API requests, process user inputs, and interact with Amazon Bedrock. Knowledge of AWS SDK for invoking Bedrock foundation models and constructing prompts for the Claude Haiku model. API and Data Management: AWS AppSync configuration for GraphQL API schema definition, resolvers, and data sources. Understanding of GraphQL operations to connect frontend requests with backend functions. Authentication: Amplify Auth setup with Amazon Cognito for user authentication, enabling secure registration, login, and session management with protected API endpoints. AI Integration: Practical knowledge of Amazon Bedrock API for model invocation, prompt engineering for travel itinerary generation, and response handling. Understanding of Claude Haiku model capabilities and constraints. Deployment: AWS Amplify configuration for continuous deployment, environment management, and web application hosting. 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Project Timeline\nMonth 1: Study AWS foundation concepts and services Month 2: Plan and design project architecture Month 3: Develop, test and deploy Week 1: AWS service setup and configuration Week 2: Backend development and Bedrock integration Week 3: Frontend development and API connection Week 4: Testing, debugging, and deployment 6. Budget Estimation Infrastructure Costs AWS Services: Amazon Bedrock: 2.10$/month AWS Lambda: 0$/month AWS Amplify: 0.27$/month AWS Appsync: 0.11$/month Amazon Cognito: 0.25$/month Total: 2.73$/month, 32.76$/month\n7. Risk Assessment Risk Potential service quotas or regional availability issues with Amazon Bedrock in the Singapore region. Hitting Bedrock or Lambda invocation limits during testing. Inconsistent itinerary quality from AI model responses. Mitigation Monitor service health dashboards. Implement prompt validation and response filtering. Contingency Use alternative AWS regions or models if primary services face limitations. Create template-based fallback itineraries. 8. Expected Outcomes Fully functional serverless application deployed on AWS Seamless integration between Amplify, AppSync, Lambda, and Bedrock Effective prompt engineering for travel itinerary generation Optimized token usage maintaining cost under $3/month Reliable model responses with consistent formatting "},{"uri":"https://kimilwoo04.github.io/Test/5-workshop/5.3-s3-vpc/5.3.2-test-gwe/","title":"Test the Gateway Endpoint","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Create S3 bucket Navigate to S3 management console In the Bucket console, choose Create bucket In the Create bucket console Name the bucket: choose a name that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been given to any bucket globally (hint: lab number and your name) Leave other fields as they are (default) Scroll down and choose Create bucket Successfully create S3 bucket. Connect to EC2 with session manager For this workshop, you will use AWS Session Manager to access several EC2 instances. Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that allows you to manage your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.\nFirst cloud journey Lab for indepth understanding of Session manager.\nIn the AWS Management Console, start typing Systems Manager in the quick search box and press Enter: From the Systems Manager menu, find Node Management in the left menu and click Session Manager: Click Start Session, and select the EC2 instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. This EC2 instance is already running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; and will be used to test connectivity to Amazon S3 through the Gateway endpoint you just created (s3-gwe).\nSession Manager will open a new browser tab with a shell prompt: sh-4.2 $\nYou have successfully start a session - connect to the EC2 instance in VPC cloud.

These IP addresses are attached to Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). AWS recommends using DNS to resolve the IP addresses for endpoints so that downstream applications use the latest IP addresses when ENIs are added to new AZs, or deleted over time.\nIn this section, you will create a forwarding rule to send DNS resolution requests from a simulated on-premises environment to a Route 53 Private Hosted Zone. This section leverages the infrastructure deployed by CloudFormation in the Prepare the environment section.\nCreate DNS Alias Records for the Interface endpoint Navigate to the Route 53 management console (Hosted Zones section). The CloudFormation template you deployed in the Prepare the environment section created this Private Hosted Zone. Click on the name of the Private Hosted Zone, s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com: Create a new record in the Private Hosted Zone: Record name and record type keep default options Alias Button: Click to enable Route traffic to: Alias to VPC Endpoint Region: US East (N. Virginia) [us-east-1] Choose endpoint: Paste the Regional VPC Endpoint DNS name from your text editor (you saved when doing section 4.3) Click Add another record, and add a second record using the following values. Click Create records when finished to create both records. Record name: *. Record type: keep default value (type A) Alias Button: Click to enable Route traffic to: Alias to VPC Endpoint Region: US East (N. Virginia) [us-east-1] Choose endpoint: Paste the Regional VPC Endpoint DNS name from your text editor The new records appear in the Route 53 console:\nCreate a Resolver Forwarding Rule Route 53 Resolver Forwarding Rules allow you to forward DNS queries from your VPC to other sources for name resolution. Outside of a workshop environment, you might use this feature to forward DNS queries from your VPC to DNS servers running on-premises. In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution. The dig command will return the IP addresses assigned to the VPC Interface endpoint running in VPC Cloud (your IP\u0026rsquo;s will be different): dig +short s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com The IP addresses returned are the VPC endpoint IP addresses, NOT the Resolver IP addresses you pasted from your text editor. The IP addresses of the Resolver endpoint and the VPC endpoint look similar because they are all from the VPC Cloud CIDR block.\nNavigate to the VPC menu (Endpoints section), select the S3 Interface endpoint. Click the Subnets tab and verify that the IP addresses returned by Dig match the VPC endpoint: Return to your shell and use the AWS CLI to test listing your S3 buckets: aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com Terminate your Session Manager session: In this section you created an Interface endpoint for Amazon S3. This endpoint can be reached from on-premises through Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints simulated forwarding DNS requests from on-premises to a Private Hosted Zone running the cloud. Route 53 inbound Endpoints recieved the resolution request and returned a response containing the IP addresses of the VPC interface endpoint. Using DNS to resolve the endpoint IP addresses provides high availability in-case of an Availability Zone outage.\n"},{"uri":"https://kimilwoo04.github.io/Test/5-workshop/5.5-policy/","title":"VPC Endpoint Policies","tags":[],"description":"","content":"When you create an interface or gateway endpoint, you can attach an endpoint policy to it that controls access to the service to which you are connecting. A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint. If you do not attach a policy when you create an endpoint, AWS attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the service through the endpoint.\nYou can create a policy that restricts access to specific S3 buckets only. This is useful if you only want certain S3 Buckets to be accessible through the endpoint.\nIn this section you will create a VPC endpoint policy that restricts access to the S3 bucket specified in the VPC endpoint policy.\nConnect to an EC2 instance and verify connectivity to S3 Start a new AWS Session Manager session on the instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. From the session, verify that you can list the contents of the bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC: aws s3 ls s3://\\\u0026lt;your-bucket-name\\\u0026gt; The bucket contents include the two 1 GB files uploaded in earlier.\nCreate a new S3 bucket; follow the naming pattern you used in Part 1, but add a \u0026lsquo;-2\u0026rsquo; to the name. Leave other fields as default and click create Successfully create bucket\nNavigate to: Services \u0026gt; VPC \u0026gt; Endpoints, then select the Gateway VPC endpoint you created earlier. Click the Policy tab. Click Edit policy. The default policy allows access to all S3 Buckets through the VPC endpoint.\nIn Edit Policy console, copy \u0026amp; Paste the following policy, then replace yourbucketname-2 with your 2nd bucket name. This policy will allow access through the VPC endpoint to your new bucket, but not any other bucket in Amazon S3. Click Save to apply the policy. { \u0026#34;Id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Policy1631305502445\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Sid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Stmt1631305501021\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;s3:*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname-2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname-2/*\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Principal\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; } ] } Successfully customize policy\nFrom your session on the Test-Gateway-Endpoint instance, test access to the S3 bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC aws s3 ls s3://\u0026lt;yourbucketname\u0026gt; This command will return an error because access to this bucket is not permitted by your new VPC endpoint policy:\nReturn to your home directory on your EC2 instance cd~ Create a file fallocate -l 1G test-bucket2.xyz Copy file to 2nd bucket aws s3 cp test-bucket2.xyz s3://\u0026lt;your-2nd-bucket-name\u0026gt; This operation succeeds because it is permitted by the VPC endpoint policy.\nThen we test access to the first bucket by copy the file to 1st bucket aws s3 cp test-bucket2.xyz s3://\u0026lt;your-1st-bucket-name\u0026gt; This command will return an error because access to this bucket is not permitted by your new VPC endpoint policy.\nPart 3 Summary: In this section, you created a VPC endpoint policy for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to test the policy. AWS CLI actions targeted to your original S3 bucket failed because you applied a policy that only allowed access to the second bucket you created. AWS CLI actions targeted for your second bucket succeeded because the policy allowed them. These policies can be useful in situations where you need to control access to resources through VPC endpoints.\n"},{"uri":"https://kimilwoo04.github.io/Test/5-workshop/","title":"Workshop","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Secure Hybrid Access to S3 using VPC Endpoints Overview AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity to AWS services from VPCs and your on-premises networks, without exposing your traffic to the Public Internet.\nIn this lab, you will learn how to create, configure, and test VPC endpoints that enable your workloads to reach AWS services without traversing the Public Internet.\nYou will create two types of endpoints to access Amazon S3: a Gateway VPC endpoint, and an Interface VPC endpoint. These two types of VPC endpoints offer different benefits depending on if you are accessing Amazon S3 from the cloud or your on-premises location\nGateway - Create a gateway endpoint to send traffic to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB using private IP addresses.You route traffic from your VPC to the gateway endpoint using route tables. Interface - Create an interface endpoint to send traffic to endpoint services that use a Network Load Balancer to distribute traffic. Traffic destined for the endpoint service is resolved using DNS.
