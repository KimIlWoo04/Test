# Summary Report: “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1”

### Event Objectives

This workshop offers a practical, foundational introduction to AWS's AI, ML, and Generative AI services. Participants will gain core knowledge of Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock, learning how to construct, launch, and manage intelligent solutions. A key focus is placed on the hands-on application of Generative AI.

### Host

- **Kha Van** 

### Key Highlights

- **End-to-End ML Platform**: A deep dive into Amazon SageMaker, mastering the end-to-end ML lifecycle from data prep and training to deployment and operationalization (MLOps).
- **Hands-On Generative AI**: A hands-on exploration of Amazon Bedrock, covering access to leading models (Claude, Llama), advanced prompting, and building a functional chatbot.
- **Architecting Intelligent Agents**: Developing advanced Bedrock Agents that perform multi-step tasks by connecting to external APIs and knowledge sources using RAG.
- **Practical Demos & Safety**: Live demonstrations of core tools, coupled with critical best practices for implementing Guardrails to promote safe, responsible AI.

### Key Takeaways

- **Actionable Knowledge of Core Services**: Differentiate the core functions of SageMaker (ML lifecycle) and Bedrock (Generative AI), selecting the right service for the task.
- **Foundational Skills in Prompt Engineering**: Employ prompt engineering strategies to improve LLM reasoning and performance.
- **Ability to Implement a RAG System**: Design the architecture for generative AI applications that harness internal data, creating domain-specific assistants.
