# Summary Report: “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2”

### Event Objectives

This workshop delivers an extensive, end-to-end overview of the DevOps methodology and its practical application on AWS. It empowers developers and operations teams with the skills to efficiently construct, deploy, and monitor scalable, reliable applications by utilizing AWS services for CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, containerization, and observability.

### Host

- **Kha Van** 

### Key Highlights

- **End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate the software release pipeline end-to-end using AWS Developer Tools (CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline), mastering advanced strategies like Blue/Green and Canary deployments.
- **Mastering Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Compare and apply declarative (CloudFormation) and programmable (CDK) approaches to infrastructure-as-code.
- **Containerization & Microservices**: Deploy and manage containerized applications using Amazon ECS, EKS, and AWS App Runner, with Amazon ECR for image management.
- **Full-Stack Observability**: Implement robust observability with CloudWatch for monitoring/logging and X-Ray for distributed tracing.
- **Real-World Best Practices**: Gain real-world insights from case studies on deployment strategies, incident response, and key DevOps performance metrics (DORA).

### Key Takeaways

- **Ability to Automate a CI/CD Pipeline**: Build an automated delivery pipeline—orchestrate AWS services for a secure, high-speed journey from code to production.
- **Practical Skills in Infrastructure as Code**: Master infrastructure as code—make informed choices between CloudFormation and CDK to provision and manage resources effectively.
- **Framework for Container Deployment**: Navigate container orchestration—understand when to leverage ECS, EKS, or App Runner for your specific microservices needs.
- **Strategy for Monitoring and Reliability**: Achieve full-stack observability—establish monitoring and tracing to foresee problems, resolve bottlenecks, and ensure reliable applications.
